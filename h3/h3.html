<b>1. Problem #15.2.</b> 
	<blockquote>
	Suppose that winning means recieving a unit of currency
	from the loser. 
	(Each time the second player wins the first player must cry out,
	<i>``You Sunk My Battleship!''</i>) <p>
	Consider the primal strategy of choosing three mutually non-overlapping 
	domino positions, and playing them each with probability 1/3.
	For each choice of square the first player will win 2/3 of the time 
	and lose 1/3 of the time, for an average winnings of 1/3 unit.
	Therefore player 1 will win at least 1/3 per trial in a
	primal-optimal strategy. <p>
	Now consider the dual strategy of choosing all three squares of the
	same color in the usual checkerboard coloring, and playing them each 
	with probability 1/3.
	For each position of a domino the second player will win 1/3 of the
	time and lose 2/3 of the time, for an average loss of 1/3 unit.
	Therefore player 1 will win at most 1/3 per trial in a
	dual-optimal strategy. <p>
	Hence the game is not fair -- its value is 1/3 unit.
	In fact, every basic primal optimal solution has the form described,
	so every optimal solution is some convex combination of the
	3 basic optimal strategies.
	Likewise, every basic dual optimal solution has the form described,
	so every optimal solution is some convex combination of the
	2 basic optimal strategies. <p>
	In fact, the same holds for larger boards.
	If the number of squares <i>s</i>on the board is even (<i>=2t</i>), 
	then the mutually non-overlapping domino positions cover the board 
	perfectly, the squares of one color account for half of all squares, 
	every domino is hit by a unique square, and every square hits a unique 
	domino, so the value of the game is <i>(t-1)/t - 1/t = (t-2)/t</i>.<p>
	If the number of squares <i>s=2t+1</i> is odd, then the dominoes
	miss exactly one square, and one of the colors includes t squares,
	while the other colors includes t+1 squares.  
	By choosing the smaller color we arrive at the same value of
	<i>(t-2)/t</i>.
	</blockquote>

<b>2. Problem #15.3.</b> 
	<blockquote>
	The problem can be rephrased by replacing the number 1,000 by any
	integer <i>n >= 3</i>.
	In any case, supposing the amount won or loss in each case is a
	single unit, the payoff matrix is anti-symmetric, which agrees with
	the obvious symmetry, and hence fairness, of the game.
	In addition, the first column dominates every column from the
	fourth on, while the first row dominates every row from the fourth on,
	so the payoff matrix reduces to the 3x3 case.
	In that case, the game is equivalent to the well-known 
	"rock-scissors-paper" game, and it is clear that each player should 
	play the numbers 1 through three, with equal probability, as their 
	optimal strategies (either by solving the associated linear program
	or by noticing that each strategy guaranteeing the corresponding
	player a nonnegative win).

<b>PROBLEM 3.</b><br><br>

<blockquote>
<b>(a) Text #19.9.</b> 
	<blockquote>

First, suppose that T is not a tree.
Then T contains a cycle C.
Let v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, ... v<sub>k</sub>
be the nodes, in order, along C, let
a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ... a<sub>k</sub>
be the arcs, in order, along C (so that each
a<sub>i</sub> joins a<sub>i</sub> to a<sub>i+1</sub>
in one direction or the other), and let
c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, ... c<sub>k</sub>
be the columns of B coresponding to these arcs.
[All subscript arithmetic is done modulo k.]
<p>

We will prove that B is singular by showing that these columns
are linearly dependent.
Define coeficients t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>, ... t<sub>k</sub>
by t<sub>i</sub>=+1 if the arc a<sub>i</sub> goes from
v<sub>i</sub> to v<sub>i+1</sub>, and t<sub>i</sub>=-1 if the
arc a<sub>i</sub> goes from v<sub>i+1</sub> to v<sub>i</sub>.
We claim that the linear combination s = t<sub>1</sub>c<sub>1</sub> +
t<sub>2</sub>c<sub>2</sub> + ... + t<sub>k</sub>c<sub>k</sub> = 0.
<p>

We will prove this by showing that every entry of s is zero.
Indeed, consider s<sub>j</sub>, which corresponds to
the node v<sub>j</sub>.
The only nonzero contributions to v<sub>j</sub> come from
t<sub>j-1</sub>c<sub>j-1</sub> and t<sub>j</sub>c<sub>j</sub>.
Regardless of the direcion of the arc a<sub>j-1</sub>, the 
definition of t<sub>j-1</sub> compensates so that the product
t<sub>j-1</sub>c<sub>j-1</sub>=+1.
Likewise, regardless of the direcion of the arc a<sub>j</sub>, the 
definition of t<sub>j</sub> compensates so that the product
t<sub>j</sub>c<sub>j</sub>=-1.
Hence, s<sub>j</sub> = t<sub>j-1</sub>c<sub>j-1</sub> +
t<sub>j</sub>c<sub>j</sub> = 0.
<p>

Second, suppose that T is a tree.
We will show that B is nonsingular by proving that det(B) is nonzero.
In fact, we will do this by permuting the rows and columns of B
to create a matrix B' which is upper triangular and has no zeros
on its diagonal.
(Such permutations are elementary row and column operations which
only multiply the determinant of B by +/-1.  Hence Hence, |det(B)|=|det(B')|>0.)
<p>

We proceed by induction on n>=2.
If n=2 then B=I<sub>1</sub>, the 1x1 identity matrix,
so the result is true.
If n>2 then let v<sub>n</sub> be a leaf of T (a node which is
incident with only one arc) which is not the node corresponding
to the truncated row of B (which is possible since there are 
always at least two leaves in any tree), and let a<sub>n</sub>
be the unique arc incident with v<sub>n</sub>.
Let B' be so that its last row corresponds to v<sub>n</sub>,
and so that its last column coresponds to a<sub>n</sub>.
Then the only nonzero entry of B' in the last row is in the
last column.
<p>

Now let T* be the tree obtained from T by removing both
v<sub>n</sub> and a<sub>n</sub>.
Then T* has n-1 nodes and n-2 arcs (and still no cycle, which is
why it is a tree), and so by the induction hypothesis the rows and
columns of its truncated incidence matrix can be permuted so that
it is upper triangular with no zeros on its diagonal.
Denote this matrix by B*, and let B' be identical to B* on its
first n-1 rows and columns.
Then B' is upper triangular with no zeros on its diagonal, as claimed.
<p>

This completes the proof.
