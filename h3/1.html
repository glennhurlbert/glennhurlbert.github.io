<b>PROBLEM 1.</b><br><br>

<blockquote>
<b>(a) Text #15.2.</b> 
	<blockquote>
	Suppose that winning means recieving a unit of currency
	from the loser. 
	(Each time the second player wins the first player must cry out,
	<i>``You Sunk My Battleship!''</i>) <p>
	Consider the primal strategy of choosing three mutually non-overlapping 
	domino positions, and playing them each with probability 1/3.
	For each choice of square the first player will win 2/3 of the time 
	and lose 1/3 of the time, for an average winnings of 1/3 unit.
	Therefore player 1 will win at least 1/3 per trial in a
	primal-optimal strategy. <p>
	Now consider the dual strategy of choosing all three squares of the
	same color in the usual checkerboard coloring, and playing them each 
	with probability 1/3.
	For each position of a domino the second player will win 1/3 of the
	time and lose 2/3 of the time, for an average loss of 1/3 unit.
	Therefore player 1 will win at most 1/3 per trial in a
	dual-optimal strategy. <p>
	Hence the game is not fair -- its value is 1/3 unit.
	In fact, every basic primal optimal solution has the form described,
	so every optimal solution is some convex combination of the
	3 basic optimal strategies.
	Likewise, every basic dual optimal solution has the form described,
	so every optimal solution is some convex combination of the
	2 basic optimal strategies. <p>
	In fact, the same holds for larger boards.
	If the number of squares <i>s</i>on the board is even (<i>=2t</i>), 
	then the mutually non-overlapping domino positions cover the board 
	perfectly, the squares of one color account for half of all squares, 
	every domino is hit by a unique square, and every square hits a unique 
	domino, so the value of the game is <i>(t-1)/t - 1/t = (t-2)/t</i>.<p>
	If the number of squares <i>s=2t+1</i> is odd, then the dominoes
	miss exactly one square, and one of the colors includes t squares,
	while the other colors includes t+1 squares.  
	By choosing the smaller color we arrive at the same value of
	<i>(t-2)/t</i>.
	</blockquote>
<b>(b) Text #15.3.</b> 
	<blockquote>
	The problem can be rephrased by replacing the number 1,000 by any
	integer <i>n >= 3</i>.
	In any case, supposing the amount won or loss in each case is a
	single unit, the payoff matrix is anti-symmetric, which agrees with
	the obvious symmetry, and hence fairness, of the game.
	In addition, the first column dominates every column from the
	fourth on, while the first row dominates every row from the fourth on,
	so the payoff matrix reduces to the 3x3 case.
	In that case, the game is equivalent to the well-known 
	"rock-scissors-paper" game, and it is clear that each player should 
	play the numbers 1 through three, with equal probability, as their 
	optimal strategies (either by solving the associated linear program
	or by noticing that each strategy guaranteeing the corresponding
	player a nonnegative win).
