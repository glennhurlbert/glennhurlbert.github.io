<b>PROBLEM 3.</b><br><br>

<blockquote>
<b>(a) Text #19.9.</b> 
	<blockquote>

First, suppose that T is not a tree.
Then T contains a cycle C.
Let v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, ... v<sub>k</sub>
be the nodes, in order, along C, let
a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ... a<sub>k</sub>
be the arcs, in order, along C (so that each
a<sub>i</sub> joins a<sub>i</sub> to a<sub>i+1</sub>
in one direction or the other), and let
c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, ... c<sub>k</sub>
be the columns of B coresponding to these arcs.
[All subscript arithmetic is done modulo k.]
<p>

We will prove that B is singular by showing that these columns
are linearly dependent.
Define coeficients t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>, ... t<sub>k</sub>
by t<sub>i</sub>=+1 if the arc a<sub>i</sub> goes from
v<sub>i</sub> to v<sub>i+1</sub>, and t<sub>i</sub>=-1 if the
arc a<sub>i</sub> goes from v<sub>i+1</sub> to v<sub>i</sub>.
We claim that the linear combination s = t<sub>1</sub>c<sub>1</sub> +
t<sub>2</sub>c<sub>2</sub> + ... + t<sub>k</sub>c<sub>k</sub> = 0.
<p>

We will prove this by showing that every entry of s is zero.
Indeed, consider s<sub>j</sub>, which corresponds to
the node v<sub>j</sub>.
The only nonzero contributions to v<sub>j</sub> come from
t<sub>j-1</sub>c<sub>j-1</sub> and t<sub>j</sub>c<sub>j</sub>.
Regardless of the direcion of the arc a<sub>j-1</sub>, the 
definition of t<sub>j-1</sub> compensates so that the product
t<sub>j-1</sub>c<sub>j-1</sub>=+1.
Likewise, regardless of the direcion of the arc a<sub>j</sub>, the 
definition of t<sub>j</sub> compensates so that the product
t<sub>j</sub>c<sub>j</sub>=-1.
Hence, s<sub>j</sub> = t<sub>j-1</sub>c<sub>j-1</sub> +
t<sub>j</sub>c<sub>j</sub> = 0.
<p>

Second, suppose that T is a tree.
We will show that B is nonsingular by proving that det(B) is nonzero.
In fact, we will do this by permuting the rows and columns of B
to create a matrix B' which is upper triangular and has no zeros
on its diagonal.
(Such permutations are elementary row and column operations which
only multiply the determinant of B by +/-1.  Hence Hence, |det(B)|=|det(B')|>0.)
<p>

We proceed by induction on n>=2.
If n=2 then B=I<sub>1</sub>, the 1x1 identity matrix,
so the result is true.
If n>2 then let v<sub>n</sub> be a leaf of T (a node which is
incident with only one arc) which is not the node corresponding
to the truncated row of B (which is possible since there are 
always at least two leaves in any tree), and let a<sub>n</sub>
be the unique arc incident with v<sub>n</sub>.
Let B' be so that its last row corresponds to v<sub>n</sub>,
and so that its last column coresponds to a<sub>n</sub>.
Then the only nonzero entry of B' in the last row is in the
last column.
<p>

Now let T* be the tree obtained from T by removing both
v<sub>n</sub> and a<sub>n</sub>.
Then T* has n-1 nodes and n-2 arcs (and still no cycle, which is
why it is a tree), and so by the induction hypothesis the rows and
columns of its truncated incidence matrix can be permuted so that
it is upper triangular with no zeros on its diagonal.
Denote this matrix by B*, and let B' be identical to B* on its
first n-1 rows and columns.
Then B' is upper triangular with no zeros on its diagonal, as claimed.
<p>

This completes the proof.
