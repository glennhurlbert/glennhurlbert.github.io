This is an area of graph theory invented by Lagarias and Saks in order to
solve a number-theoretic question of Erdos and Lemke.
Chung popularized the theory by successfully carrying out their plan.
A pebbling step from a vertex $u$ to a vertex $v$ in a graph
consists of removing two pebbles from $u$ and adding one pebble to $v$
(think of the lost pebble as a toll).
The pebbling number of a graph $G$ is the smallest $t$ so that,
from any initial distributions of $t$ pebbles to the vertices of $G$,
one can place a pebble on any specified vertex after an appropriate sequence
of pebbling steps.
It is not hard to see that the pebbling number of a complete graph on $n$
vertices equals $n$, and the pebbling number of a path on $n$ vertices
equals $2^{n-1}$.
Slightly more challenging is to prove that the pebbling number of the</a>
<a class="menu" href="peter.jpg">Petersen graph</a>
<a class="normal">is $10$.
The holy grail of the field is a conjecture of Graham, bounding the pebbling
number of a cartesian product of graphs by the product of their pebbling 
numbers.

An $(n,k)$ deBruijn-Good sequence is a cyclic sequence containing every
$k$-ary $n$-tuple exactly once as a contiguous subsequence.
For example, $00000100101100111110001101110101$
is one for $(n,k)=(5,2)$, and
$000222122021121020120011101$
is one for $(n,k)=(3,3)$.
A Universal Cycle is a generalization of this idea for other combinatorial
structures, such as $k$-subsets of $[n]$, permutations of $[n]$, 
partitions of $[n]$, $k$-dimensional subspaces of a vector space, etc.
For example, $13567256823472357814782456145712361246783671345834681256$
lists all $3$-subsets of $[8]$ exacly once.
The biggest open problem here is the \$250 CDG conjecture: for every $k$ and
every large $n$ (maybe only $n\ge k+2$ ?) for which $n$ divides
$n\choose k$ there is a Ucycle for $k$-subsets of $[n]$.

My interest here is mainly on shadows of set systems.
For a family $\cal F$ of sets of size $t$, is shadow $\partial \cal F$
consists of all sets of size $t-1$ that are contained in some
set of $\cal F$.
The Kruskal-Katona theorem says that every family of $m$ sets has
a shadow of at least $k(m)$, where $k(m)$ is explicitly described
but cumbersome to compute.
I used this theorem in</a>

Lovasz replaced $k(m)$ by a much simpler function $l(m)$
to compute.
The Clements-Linstrom and Macauley theorems are analogs of the
Kruskal-Katona result for multisets, and I was able to prove
a Lovasz-type version and include it in a

Cayley proved that there are $n^{n-2}$ labeled trees on 
$n$ vertices, which is the same as saying there are that many
spanning trees of the labelled complete graph.
Prufer gave a distinct name to each of them, exhausting all possible
$n$-ary $(n-2)$-tuples as names, thus giving a bijective
proof of Cayley's result.

Linear Optimization (formerly known as Linear Programming) essentially
deals with optimizing linear functions over linear constraints.
Of course, the subject is far richer than just that, reaching into
convex geometry, linear algebra, probability, combinatorics, game theory,
graph theory, and algorithms among other areas.
It is also a springboard to related fields including integer, convex, and
combinatorial optimization.
I am in the process of publishing my undergraduate

In the process of writing I made a few discoveries that I am currently
writing up: one regarding the equivalence of seemingly different 
implementations of the Simplex method, two involving combinatorial
geometry, and another in graph theory.
Also, I have invented a new algorithm for solving linear optimization
problems (LOPs) that seems to behave nicely and run quickly.
Some colleagues and I are writing code now for the community to test
