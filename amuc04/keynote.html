"Voici ce que j'ai trouve (Here is what I have found):<br>
Sophie Germain's rediscovered manuscripts on Fermat's Last Theorem"

Abstract:
</b></font>
Sophie Germain is best known in number theory <br> 
for the first general result aimed at proving Fermat's Last Theorem. <br>
However, her unpublished manuscripts, and a letter to Gauss, reveal that, <br>
for her, this result was only minor fallout from a grand plan she pursued <br>
for proving the theorem outright. The scope of Germain's attempt remained <br>
unequaled for half a century, until her path was unknowingly trodden again <br>
by others. We will explore her grand plan and its side thrusts, including <br>
remarkable lower bounds on the size of possible solutions to Fermat's equation.
