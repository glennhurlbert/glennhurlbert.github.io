			FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT

		ASU MATHEMATICS IS RUNNING AMUC!

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

    The First Annual Arizona Mathematics Undergraduate Conference
    (AMUC) is being held on the campus of Arizona State University,
    February 27-29, 2004.

    The goal of the conference is to welcome undergraduates to the
    wonderful world of mathematics research, to develop and foster a
    rich social network between the mathematics students and faculty
    throughout the great Southwest, and to celebrate the accomplishments
    of our undergraduate students.  We encourage undergraduate students
    from all years of study to participate and give presentations on all
    areas of mathematics, including applications to other disciplines.
    However, while we do recommend giving a talk, it is not a requirement
    for conference participation.

    Faculty are encouraged to challenge their students with interesting
    projects to present at the conference.  Feel free also to nominate
    for participation students who will not give a talk but who would
    benefit from attending.  The registration process will include
    input from a faculty sponsor.  We recommend, if possible, that
    one faculty member from each school attend for every 4-6 of their
    students who participate.

CONFERENCE FORMAT

    The conference will take place at the Holiday Inn on the southwest
    corner of campus.  Registration will begin on Friday afternoon and
    will be followed by the opening dinner and then the Inaugural
    Lecture.

    Saturday will be filled by 15-minute presentations by students, most
    likely in parallel sessions, followed by a problem session before
    dinner.  If participation is high we may also consider having a poster
    session.  Breakfast, lunch and the conference banquet dinner will
    be provided, and our Keynote Speaker will give a talk before lunch.

    There will be more talks on Sunday morning after breakfast, and we
    will close the conference with some barbeque and volleyball at Tempe
    Lake around noon.

LODGING

    A block of rooms has been reserved at the Holiday Inn.  Students will
    be paired to share rooms and may submit their roommate preference to
    us on the registration form.

REGISTRATION

    The conference website is under construction and will be ready soon.
    Students will be able to register and submit an abstract if they
    intend to give a talk.  Support for travel, lodging and food is
    expected to cover most students and is available on a first-come
    basis.  There is the possibility that we will obtain extra funding
    that will support a limited number of faculty as well.

    The registration deadline is January 9, 2003.

SUPPORT

    Generous support for AMUC is being supplied by the following
    Institutions.

	Arizona State University
	Mathematics Association of America
	Northern Arizona University
	Rocky Mountain Mathematics Consortium
	SUMS Institute
	University of Arizona
