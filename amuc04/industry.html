"The many roles enjoyed by mathematicians at NSA"
<br><br><br>

<font size="+2"><b>
Abstract:
</b></font>
The National Security Agency (NSA) has historically hired <br>
hundreds of mathematicians to perform a whole host of jobs relating to <br>
its dual mission. The range of jobs available is large and, through each, <br>
mathematicians play a significant and sometimes direct role in the national <br>
security reports that are provided to the President, national policymakers, and <br>
military commanders. This talk will address some of the ways mathematicians <br>
are used to fulfill the NSA missions, the work environment within which they <br>
perform, and the kinds of mathematics employed.
