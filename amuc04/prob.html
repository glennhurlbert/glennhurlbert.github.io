<b><font color="#990000" size="+1"> PROBLEM SESSION. </font></b>
The last gathering on Saturday afternoon before the
<a href="banq.html">Conference Banquet</a>
will be the Problem Session.
Students and faculty alike will be able to share interesting
problems that could spur future undergraduate research.
Possibly, talks might be given at AMUC '05 on some of these problems!
<p>

<b><font color="#990000" size="+1"> PROBLEM SUBMISSION. </font></b>
Problems submitted should be able to be presented in one or two minutes.
<b>This is not an opportunity to squeeze in another talk!</b>
