<b><font color="#990000" size="+1"> CONFERENCE GOAL. </font></b>
The goal of the conference is to welcome undergraduates to the
wonderful world of mathematics research, to develop and foster a
rich social network between the mathematics students and faculty
throughout the great Southwest, and to celebrate the accomplishments
of our undergraduate students.  
We encourage undergraduate students from <b>all years of study </b>
to participate and give presentations on <b>all areas of mathematics</b>, 
including applications to other disciplines.
However, while we do recommend giving a talk, it is not a requirement
for conference participation.
<p>

<b><font color="#990000" size="+1"> PARTICIPATION. </font></b>
Faculty are encouraged to challenge their students with interesting
projects to present at the conference.  
Feel free also to nominate for participation students who will not 
give a talk but who would benefit from attending.  
The 
<a href="regis.html"> registration </a>
process will include input from a faculty mentor.  
(We recommend, if possible, that one faculty member from each school 
attend for every 4-6 of their students who participate.)
The registration process will also include an entry for the
<a href="http://www.ams.org/msc/index.html#browse" target="_blank"> 
2000 Mathematical Subject Classification </a> of the topic of your talk.
<p>

<b><font color="#990000" size="+1"> TALKS. </font></b>
Student talks will be 15 minutes in length, with 5 minutes between talks
for discussion, and will be grouped according to topic in parallel sessions.
Please check the box on the registration form which you will require: an
overhead projector or a proxima.
(You are responsible for providing your own laptop.)
Students unaccustomed to making presentations may find any of the following

Topics can range from elementary known material to challenging generalizations
of known theorems to entirely new results.
Interesting applications of mathematics to other disciplines, as well as
historical talks are also welcomed.
<p>

<b><font color="#990000" size="+1"> POSTERS. </font></b>
In the event that more students want to speak than there is time or space for,
we may include a poster session.
The 
<a href="regis.html"> registration </a>
process will include a box for participants to note whether or not they
would be willing to present in poster form in such a case.
<p>

<b><font color="#990000" size="+1"> DEADLINE. </font></b>
Please register by <b>January 24, 2004</b>.
