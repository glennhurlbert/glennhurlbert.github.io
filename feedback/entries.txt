<div class="entry"><div class="name">Type: Typo Correction</div><div class="info">Chapter: 1 | Section: 4</div><p>On  page  9,  workout  1.4.1,  you  ask  us  to  change  problem  1.3.1  into  a  form  of  equalities  with  free  variables.  Did  you  mean  the  form  of  equalities  with  slack  variables?  We  can  transform  inequalities  into  equalities  with  the  use  of  nonnegative  slack  variables,  which,  of  course,  are  restricted  by  their  lower  bound,  so  they  are  not  free  variables.</p><div class="date">Thursday, January 17, 2013 @ 10:51 am</div></div>
