<div class="entry"><div class="name">Type: Comments</div><div class="info">Chapter: 4 | Section: 4</div><p>In  Workout  4.4.4(b)  it  asks  us  to  show  that  x'=(0,7,1,0,0)  is  not  optimal,  but  it  isn't  even  feasible.    Should  that  be  changed  to  something  that  is  feasible  yet  not  optimal?</p><div class="date">Monday, March 5, 2007 @ 1:18 pm</div></div>
<div class="entry"><div class="name">Type: Comments</div><div class="info">Chapter: 2 | Section: 1</div><p>In  Section  2.1  the  simplex  algorithm  is  mentioned  stating  that  it  is  cominup  soon.  Then  in  Section  2.2  Phase  1  and  Phase  2  are  defined  as  being  part  of  the  Simplex  algorithm  however  it  itself  has  not  yet  been  defined.  Then  it  states  "Obviously,  the  Simplex  algorithm  will  halt  at  this  stage..."  Nothing  can  be  obvious  for  the  algorithm  until  after  it  has  been  defined.  Continuing  on,  there  is  a  paragraph  that  starts  "These  are  the  workings  of  the  Simplex  algorithm..."  This  seems  to  decribe  the  algorithm  without  ever  giving  an  actual  definition.  If  this  Paragrah  is  intended  to  be  the  definition,  then  perhaps  it  should  be  labeled  as  such.</p><div class="date">Friday, February 23, 2007 @ 11:40 am</div></div>
<div class="entry"><div class="name">Type: Typos</div><div class="info">Chapter: 1 | Section: 2</div><p>For  the  Matching  Problem,  Pofessor  Elster  is  qualified  to  teach  Math  401,  402,  403,  405,  and  408,  however  throughout  the  rest  of  the  example  it  seems  tht  he  teachs  400  and  not  401.  So  I  believe  the  easiest  fix  is  to  change  the  initial  401  to  400.</p><div class="date">Friday, February 23, 2007 @ 11:33 am</div></div>
