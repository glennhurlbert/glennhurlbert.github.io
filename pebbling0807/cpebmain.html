In terms of possible applications it may be relevant to consider having to
move a pebble to every vertex simultaneously, rather than to just one root.
More generally, given a weight function
$w$
on the vertices of a graph
$G$,
We define the
<a class="pdef">weighted cover pebbling number</a>
$\gamma_w(G)$
to be the minimum number of pebbles needed to place, after a sequence of pebbling steps, 
$w(v)$
pebbles on vertex
$v$,
for all
<a class="mit">v</a>,
regardless of the initial configuration.
The
<a class="pdef">cover pebbling number</a>
$\gamma(G)$
regards the case
$w(v)=1$
for all
$v$.
We say that
$w$
is

<a name="simple">
It would be interesting to find the weighted pebbling numbers of other graph 
classes and also random graphs.
The main technique in proving the
<a class="tlink" href="cpebmain.html#trees">Cover Pebbling Tree Theorem</a>
involves showing that the largest $w$-unsolvable configuration is
<a class="pdef">simple</a>;
that is, concentrated ("stacked") on a single vertex.
The same cannot be said in general for weight functions that are not positive.
An important question to investigate along these lines is whether, for 
arbitrary graphs and positive weight functions, the largest $w$-unsolvable 
configuration is always simple.
A positive answer is found in the following theorem,
proved independently in
<a class="plink" href="biblmain.html#Sjos_CPT">[Sjo,</a>

<a name="cov" class="phead">Cover Pebbling Ratio</a>

<blockquote>
<a name="star">
We define the
<a class="pdef">cover pebbling ratio</a>
of
$G$
to be
$\rho(G)=\gamma(G)/\pi(G)$.
For a class
${\cal F}$
of graphs we define
$\rho({\cal F})={\rm sup}_{G \in {\cal F}}\rho(G)$
if it exists, and
$\rho({\cal F})=\infty$
otherwise.
Thus, for the families
${\cal K}$
of
<a class="pdeflink" href="complete.jpg">complete</a>
graphs, 
${\cal S}$
of
<a class="pdeflink" href="star.jpg" title="a single vertex adjacent to each of n independent vertices">stars</a>,
and
${\cal P}$
of
<a class="pdeflink" href="path.jpg">paths</a>, we have
$\rho({\cal K})=\rho({\cal S})=\rho({\cal P})=2$.

<p>
<a name="fuse">
The
<a class="pdeflink" href="fuse.jpg">fuse</a>
$F_l(n)$
is the graph on
$n$
vertices composed of a path (or wick) on
$l$
vertices with
$n-l$
independent vertices (sparks) incident to one of its endpoints.
(These are also called brooms, with handle and bristles, in
<a class="plink" href="cpebmain.html#EFS">[EFS]</a>.)
As a special case of the
<a class="tlink" href="cpebmain.html#trees">Cover Pebbling Tree Theorem</a>
we know that
the cover pebbling number of fuses is
$\gamma(F_l(n))=(n-l+1)2^l-1$.
Likewise, as a special case of the
<a class="tlink" href="pnummain.html#tree">Pebbling Tree Theorem</a>
we also know that the pebbling number of fuses is 
$\pi(F_l(n))=2^l+n-l+1$.
As a result, we obtain the cover pebbling ratio for fuses.
In particular, for
$n=2^l+l$,
we have 
$\rho(F_l(n)) > (n-\log n)/2$.

This implies that the cover pebbling ratio for the class of trees is unbounded

<blockquote>
<a class="tnam">Cover Pebbling Ratio Tree Theorem.</a> &#160
<a class="tmat">Let ${\cal T}$ be the family of all trees.  Then $\rho({\cal T})=\infty$.</a>
</blockquote>

It would be of interest to find other classes of graphs (like cliques
and stars and paths) which have bounded cover pebbling ratio.

<a name="weighted">
<a name="wcp" class="phead">Weighted Pebbling Number</a>

<blockquote>
Finally, we define the
<a class="pdef">weighted pebbling number</a>
$\pi_{\mathbf{w}}(G)$
to be the minimum number
$t$
so that, for every weight function
$w$
with
$|w|=\mathbf{w}$,
every configuration of
$t$
pebbles is $w$-solvable.
Note that the target weight function
$w$
is fixed in the definition of 
weighted cover pebbling number, while for weighted pebbling number
every target weight function
$w$
of size
$|w| = \mathbf{w}$ 
must be solvable.
If one is concerned only with positive
$w$,
then such an evaluation on any tree
$T$
is trivial.
One would compute 
$\max_w \max_v \sum_u 2^{d(u,v)} = \max_v \max_w \sum_u 2^{d(u,v)} = \max_v |w|2^{\max_u d(u,v)} = \mathbf{w} 2^{{\rm diam}(T)}$.
However, nonpositive
$w$
must be considered, and thus finding weighted cover pebbling numbers for such
$w$
is critical.
