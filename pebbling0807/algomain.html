<a name="fra" class="phead">Fractional Pebbling</a>

<blockquote>
Many combinatorial optimization parameters have fractional counterparts.
Graph parameters like chromatic number and matching number
<a class="plink" href="algomain.html#ScUl">[ScUl]</a>
are well known examples, as is the dimension of posets
<a class="plink" href="algomain.html#BrSc">[BrSc]</a>,
and the pebbling number is no exception.
Let
$\pi(G,k)$
be the minimum
$t$
such that, for every choice of
<a class="pdeflink" href="pnummain.html#root">root</a>
$r$
and for every
<a class="pdeflink" href="pnummain.html#configuration">configuration</a>
of
$t$
pebbles on
$G$,
it is possible to move
$k$
pebbles to
$r$.
Then the
<a class="pdef">fractional pebbling number</a>
$\hat{\pi}(G)=\liminf_{k \rightarrow \infty}\pi(G,k)/k$.
(Because
$\pi(G,sk) \leq s \pi(G,k)$
for all 
$s > 0$,
we can replace
$\liminf$
by
$\lim$
in the definition.)
For example,
$\hat{\pi}(K_n) = \liminf_{k \rightarrow \infty}(n+2k-2)/k=2$.
Also, using
<a class="alink" href="authmain.html#FanChu">Chung's</a>
<a class="tlink" href="pnummain.html#tree">Pebbling Tree Theorem</a>
<a class="plink" href="biblmain.html#Chun_PH">[Chu]</a>,
it is easy to compute
$\hat{\pi}(T)=2^{{\rm diam}(T)}$
for every tree
$T$.
Based on this and other evidence,
<a class="alink" href="authmain.html#GleHur">Hurlbert</a>
made the following conjecture.

<blockquote>
<a class="tnam">Fractional Pebbling Conjecture.</a> &#160
<a class="tmat">For every graph $G$ we have that $\hat{\pi}(G)=2^{{\rm diam}(G)}$.</a>
</blockquote>

Typically, the parameter in question can be formulated in terms of an integer 
linear program, and the relaxation of the program gives rise to the fractional 
version of the parameter.
In the case of graph pebbling, while it is routine to verify in polynomial time
that a particular configuration reaches a particular root, no simple matrix 
condition as yet exists to capture whether every configuration of a fixed size
$t$
is solvable for a particular root.
Thus minimizing
$t$
as an integer program remains elusive, and so it is difficult
to say at present whether or not a parameter exists that is dual to
$\pi$.
<a class="alink" href="authmain.html#AroLou">Lourdusamy</a>
and
<a class="alink" href="authmain.html#SSom">Somasundaram</a>
<a class="plink" href="biblmain.html#LouSom_PCU">[LoSo]</a>
found a proof that verifies 
<a class="tlink" href="gconmain.html#GCon">Graham's Conjecture</a>
for the case
$C_5 \times C_5$.
Their proof uses linear programming and lends credence to the above ideas 
while suggesting that further explorations into the connections between 
linear programming duality and pebbling numbers may be fruitful and 
worthwhile indeed.

<a name="com" class="phead">Complexity</a>

<blockquote>
Because it is easy to verify a pebbling solution, the question of deciding
whether a given configuration
$C$
reaches a given root
$r$
is in
<font face="Gill Sans">NP</font>.
In fact it has been shown
<a class="plink" href="biblmain.html#HurKie_CGP">[HuKi]</a>
that this question is at least as hard as 
<font face="Gill Sans">NP-complete</font>.
(see also
<a class="plink" href="biblmain.html#MilCla_CGP">[MiCl</a>,
<a class="plink" href="biblmain.html#Wats_CPC">Wat]</a>).
</p>

<blockquote>
<a name="CLB" class="tnam">Complexity Lower Bound.</a> &#160
<a class="tmat">For every $4$-regular hypergraph $H$, there is a graph $G$,
a configuration $C$, and a root $r$, so that deciding if $C$ reaches
$r$ in $G$ is at least as hard as deciding if $H$ has a perfect matching.</a>
</blockquote>

The following complexity upper bound is found in
<a class="plink" href="biblmain.html#MilCla_CGP">[MiCl]</a>.

<blockquote>
<a class="tnam">Complexity Upper Bound.</a> &#160
<a class="tmat">Deciding whether $\pi(G) \leq k$ is $a$ $\Pi_2^P-complete$ problem.</a>
</blockquote>

This means that it is complete for the class of languages computable
in polynomial time by <font face="Gill Sans">co-NP</font>
machines equipped with an oracle for an
<font face="Gill Sans">NP-complete</font> language.
They also proved that deciding whether
$\pi^*(G) \leq k$
is
<font face="Gill Sans">NP-complete</font>,
while the same result is proved in
<a class="plink" href="biblmain.html#Wats_CPC">[Wat]</a>
for deciding whether
$\gamma(G) \leq k$.
</blockquote>

<a name="app" class="phead">Approximations</a>

<blockquote>
Instead of computing
$\pi(G)$
exactly, one could try to approximate it. 
In other words the following question is of interest.

<blockquote>
<a class="tnam">Pebbling Approximation Question.</a> &#160
<a class="tmat">Does there exist a (constant/linear/polynomial) function $F(n)$
and an algorithm which, given a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, can find a
number in polynomial time $\overline{\pi}(G)$ such that $|\pi(G)-\overline{\pi}(G)| \leq F(n)$?</a>
</blockquote>

Just like in the case of other "hard" problems one can  design a "good" 
approximation algorithm for special cases of graphs. 
In particular, is it possible to design an approximation algorithm for the 
case when
$G$
is a dense graph?
Perhaps an easier and more natural question is to ask for an algorithm which, 
given a configuration and a root, will pebble to the root efficiently.

<blockquote>
<a class="tnam">Pebbling Solution Question.</a> &#160
<a class="tmat">Does there exist an algorithm which,
given a graph $G$, a root $r$, and an $r$-solvable configuration $C$,
can pebble to $r$ in time polynomial in $n$?</a>
</blockquote>

Of course, the
<a class="tlink" href="algomain.html#CLB">Complexity Lower Bound</a>
shows that this is in general impossible unless
<font face="Gill Sans">P = NP</font>,
although the question for appropriately restricted 
classes of graphs, such as cubes, remains interesting.
</blockquote>

<a name="gre" class="phead">Greedy Algorithms</a>

<blockquote>
A solution is greedy (semi-greedy) if every step in the solution is
<a class="pdeflink" href="gconmain.html#greedy">greedy</a>.
A graph
$G$
is greedy if every configuration of size
$\pi(G)$
has a greedy soultion.
Trees, cubes, and products of paths are greedy
<a class="plink" href="biblmain.html#ClHoHu_PDT">[CHH]</a>.
The $5$-cycle
$abcde$
is not yet greedy, as witnessed by the configuration
$C(c,d)=(3,2)$
with root
$a$.
Worse yet, let
$H$
be the
<a class="pdeflink" href="hgraph.jpg">graph</a>
formed from the $6$-cycle
$abcdef$
by adjoining new vertices
$g$
to
$a$
and
$c$,
and
$h$
to
$a$
and
$e$.
It is not difficult to show that
$f(H)=9$.
Then the configuration
$C(a,b,f,g,h)=(1,3,3,1,1)$
is not semi-greedily
$d$-solvable, so
$H$
is not semi-greedy.
<p>
Consider
(<a class ="pdeflink" href="ggraph.jpg">see</a>)
the
<a class="pdeflink" href="pnummain.html#book">book</a>
$B_{3,3}=P_3 \times S_4$
($S_4$
is the star
$K_{1,3}$).
Both
$P_3$
and
$K_{1,3}$
are greedy because they are trees.
However,
$B_{3,3}$
is not even semi-greedy.
Indeed, think of 
$B_{3,3}$
as the pages of a book, let
$r$
be the corner vertex of one of the pages,
$x$
the farthest corner vertex of a second page,
$u$,
$v$,
and
$w$
the three vertices of the third page, and let
$C(u,v,w,x)=(1,1,1,15)$.
From the
<a class="pdeflink" href="pnummain.html#pra">Practice</a>
section we know that 
$\pi(B_{3,3})=18$,
so
$C$
is solvable.
However, 
$C$
has no greedy solution.
This shows that even semi-greediness is not always preserved by 
<a class="pdeflink" href="gconmain.html#CaPr">cartesian product</a>.
This is especially disappointing since it shoots down a promising
method of attack on
<a class="tlink" href="gconmain.html#GCon">Graham's Conjecture</a>.
Knowing that a graph is greedy would be of great aid in solving some pebbling
configuration on the graph via computer.
Thus it is worth attempting to characterize greedy graphs, or at least
building up an encycolpedia of greedy graphs.
</p>

<a name="treesol">
<p>
We say a graph
$G$
is
<a class="pdef">tree-solvable</a>
if every configuration of size at least
$\pi(G)$
has a solution in which the edges traversed by pebbling steps
form an acyclic subgraph.
The graph
$H$
defined above is not tree-solvable.
Indeed, the configuration
$C(b,c,d,g,h)=(1,5,1,1,1)$
has no tree-solution for the root
$f$.
The configuration on
$B_{3,3}$
above is not tree-solvable either, which shows that
tree-solvability is also not always preserved by
<a class="pdeflink" href="gconmain.html#CaPr">cartesian product</a>.
Another simple example is the
<a class="pdeflink" href="cube.jpg">cube</a>
$Q^3$:
place $5$ pebbles at distance $3$
from the root 
$r$,
and $1$ pebble at each of the three vertices at distance $2$
from
$r$.
Thus, not even greedy graphs are guaranteed to be tree-solvable.
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, the methods used in random pebbling suggest that almost all
configurations above the
<a class="pdeflink" href="rpebmain.html#thre">pebbling threshold</a>
have greedy tree-solutions.
Thus, it is reasonable to use a greedy algorithm to pare off most
configurations, leaving possibly few configurations that require more
sophisticated algorithms for solving.
