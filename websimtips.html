  If you discover any clever uses not listed here, or have an idea for a
  clever tool to add to WebSim, please send email to Glenn
  Hurlbert at <i>mylastname at asu dot edu</i> with the subject line
  <b>WebSim Tip</b>.
  <br><br>
  <li>
    <b>Saving</b> a sequence of tableaux is accomplished by saving the page
    in your browser.  However, while it may be useful later to load that page 
    into your browser so that you may continue working on the problem, you
    will not be able to pivot on it.  Instead, you must open a new tab,
    copy it over and work in the new tab. 
  <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Exploration and discovery</b> is facilitated by employing multiple
    tabs.  From a tab labeled X, use the
</a>
<a class="menu" href="websimbutttab.html" target="websimmain">
  tableau button
</a>
<a class="normal">
    to <i>Copy Tableau to New Window</i>.  Doing that several times opens
    new windows (better yet, tabs --- see
</a>
<a class="menu" href="websimbrow.html" target="websimmain">
  Browsers
</a>
<a class="normal">
    ) with labels XA, XB, etc.  From these identical tableaux one can
    perform different pivots for comparison, among other inquiry-based
    operations.
  <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    When solving ILOPs via <b>cutting planes</b>, when it comes time to 
    add a new constraint, you must add a new slack variable column as well.
    Instead of adding them separately, you can add them at the same time 
    by using <i>Add Row and Column After</i> in the menu of the cell after 
    which you want them added.
    <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    When solving ILOPs via <b>branch and bound</b>, follow the same advice
    as for cutting planes, above, regarding the inclusion of new constraints.
    Also, use new tabs (as in the exploration advice, above) for the
    branching process.
