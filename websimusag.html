  link at left.  This will pop up a
  new tab with a simple form, prompting you to choose whether the problem
  consists of inequalities or equalities.  A third option, <i>Empty</i>,
  allows you to simply paste an existing tableau that you might have
  copied from Maple or a word processing program.
  In this case you should enter the value of the basic coefficient,
  which is set to 1 as the default otherwise.
  <br><br>
  After you have selected the type of constraints in your problem, a
  few more prompts show up.  One of these allows you to choose whether
  the problem is a linear optimization problem (LOP) or a system of
  constraints.  The only difference between the two types of problems is
  that a LOP will contain a <i>z-column</i> and an <i>objective row</i>,
  whereas a system will not.  You are also prompted to enter the number
  of variables and constraints in the problem, after which you should
  click <b>Done</b>.
  <br><br> 
  At this point a table appears with the slack variable coefficients
  filled in (and the z-column as well if the problem is a LOP).
  The table of numbers in the middle represents a tableau which can be
  edited or pivoted on at any time.  The tab and arrows keys move from
  one cell to another to allow data entry and editing --- experiment
  with them to see how they wrap around horizontally and vertically.

  The 
</a>
<a class="menu" href="websimbutt.html" target="websimmain">
  Buttons 
</a>
<a class="normal">
  to the left and above the tableau are used for popping up menus.
  In order to pop-up a menu, simply right-click any button or entry.
  The button above and to the left is called the <i>tableau button</i>,
  the buttons directly above the tableau are called <i>column buttons</i>,
  and the buttons directly to the left of the tableau are called <i>row
  buttons</i>.
  <br><br> 
  <b>Pivoting</b> can be accomplished simply by double-clicking on the entry 
  on which you wish to pivot.  The resulting tableau will appear beneath 
  the current tableau, and the page will automatically scroll to show only
  the resulting tableau.  (Scrolling between tableau can be useful for
  class discussions when discovering or witnessing patterns.  Also, one can
  scroll up to a prior tableau and pivot on it successfully.)  Note that
  integer arithmetic is used, so that one needs to divide by the <i>basic
  coefficient</i> in order to calculate curent basic and objective values.
  <br><br> 
  It is also visually useful to draw lines between various rows, to separate
  constraints from the objective row, for example (and also original
  constraints from new valid inequalities from cutting planes), and between 
  various columns, to separate problem variables, slack variables, and the
  <i>b-column</i>.  This can be accomplished by clicking on the black
  lines between the buttons.
  <br><br> 
  <b>Saving</b> a sequence of tableaux is accomplished by saving the page
  in your browser.  Later, when you open that page in your browser you
  will see the sequence but it is not an active page (you will not be
  able to pivot or use any buttons).
