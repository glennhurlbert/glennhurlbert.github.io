You might be interested in clicking on the Lin Opt logo above,
in order to download excerpts from the different chapters of the
students' version of my book.
This may help you get a feel for my pedagogical approach to the subject.
Each of you will be getting your own copy of the teachers' version, 
which fills in everything missing from the students' version.
<p>
I will include more speciafic materials here in May for participants to 
download in preparation for the workshop.
