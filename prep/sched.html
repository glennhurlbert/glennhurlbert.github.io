Each day (Wednesday, June 25 through Sunday, June 29) will begin at 8:30 
and end at 4:30.

developed with one of my former students for teaching and learning

<p>
We intend to enjoy meals together in general, but will leave some time on 
Friday afternoon and evening for people to visit various attractions on 
their own or in groups.
