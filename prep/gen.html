This particular workshop is on the topic of Linear Optimization
and will run June 25-29, 2008, at the

<p>
Linear Optimization is an established field of applied mathematics
typically taught to engineers and business students. However, it is also
a rich and exciting subject of pure mathematics with a long and storied
history containing fertile ideas that connect it with many branches
of mathematics, including linear algebra, geometry, probability,
combinatorics, algorithms, computing, game theory, economics, graph
theory, and modeling.
<p>
Because of its breadth and both pure and applied nature, the topic can be
used as a kind of capstone or honors project course as well as a standard
course. Moreover, with current technology, students armed only with half
a typical linear algebra course under their belts can be led to discover
the main theorems of the subject, making Linear Optimization useful as
an introduction to proofs course as well. Some of its applications to
geometry and game theory are downright fun, as we'll see.
<p>
By the end of the workshop, participants will be ready to teach a
full-semester course to undergraduates in mathematics, engineering, and
business, as well as to include parts of the subject in other courses
as supplemental material, research projects, or honors theses. They will
also be ready to try innovative teaching methods in their class, including
the use of various technologies, software, and inquiry-based approaches.
<p>
Participants will also receive a free copy of
