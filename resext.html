My interest here is mainly on shadows of set systems.
For a family $\cal F$ of sets of size $t$, is shadow $\partial \cal F$
consists of all sets of size $t-1$ that are contained in some
set of $\cal F$.
The Kruskal-Katona theorem says that every family of $m$ sets has
a shadow of size at least $k(m)$, where $k(m)$ is explicitly described
but cumbersome to compute.
I used this theorem in</a>

Lovasz replaced $k(m)$ by a much simpler function $l(m)$
to compute.
The Clements-Linstrom and Macauley theorems are analogs of the
Kruskal-Katona result for multisets, and I was able to prove
a Lovasz-type version and include it in a

the subset lattice, which used Lovasz's estimate).

graph sequence), is included in the special volume
