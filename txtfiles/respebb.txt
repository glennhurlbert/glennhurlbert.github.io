This is an area of graph theory invented by Lagarias and Saks in order to
solve a number-theoretic question of Erdos and Lemke.
Chung popularized the theory by successfully carrying out their plan.
A pebbling step from a vertex $u$ to a vertex $v$ in a graph
consists of removing two pebbles from $u$ and adding one pebble to $v$
(think of the lost pebble as a toll).
The pebbling number of a graph $G$ is the smallest $t$ so that,
from any initial distributions of $t$ pebbles to the vertices of $G$,
one can place a pebble on any specified vertex after an appropriate sequence
of pebbling steps.
It is not hard to see that the pebbling number of a complete graph on $n$
vertices equals $n$, and the pebbling number of a path on $n$ vertices
equals $2^{n-1}$.
Slightly more challenging is to prove that the pebbling number of the</a>

<a class="normal">is $10$.
The holy grail of the field is a conjecture of Graham, bounding the pebbling
number of a cartesian product of graphs by the product of their pebbling
numbers.
